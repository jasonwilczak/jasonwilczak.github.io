It was an amazing experience, but I learned that getting published was actually going to be the hard part. I hit a few road blocks and stumbled a bit on getting any bites or interest. Additionally, I got some feedback from beta readers and took all the information to heart and got back to work.</p> <p>Then we got hit by a pandemic….</p> <p>You would think that being home and basically locked inside would have been the perfect situation for writing! Unfortunately, the way my writing process worked caused me to completely de-rail. I simply couldn’t find the words and the determination to literally do anything. That sort of bundled up with the changes I needed to make, the steam just stopped…</p> <p>Well, here I am again, I’m back. I got a new laptop that I can use unplugged, which is nice, and I started getting back into D&amp;D with my kids. Suddenly, the inspiration is back and I am ready to make progress again. Here we go!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="simple-posts"/><category term="simple"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[getting back into the swing]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Up and Running!</title><link href="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/up-and-running/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Up and Running!"/><published>2017-12-06T22:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-06T22:16:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/up-and-running</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/up-and-running/"><![CDATA[<p>Looks like the blog is up and running!</p> <p>I used Amazon’s Lightsail offering and it was a breeze!  I coupled it all with my Namecheap domain registrar and was up and running in no time.  I would suggest looking into it!</p> <p>I also came across Wattpad and feel like I’ve been living under a rock…looking forward to pumping out a few short stories!</p> <p>On top of that, working on that next book and looking for agents for book 1</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="simple-posts"/><category term="simple"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[finally got the blog up and running]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World</title><link href="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World"/><published>2017-08-04T12:08:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-08-04T12:08:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasonwilczak.github.io/blog/2017/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a developer by trade so, obligatory hello world post to indicate everything is up and running :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="simple-posts"/><category term="simple"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[just getting started]]></summary></entry></feed>
