So, I received a question from someone about novel length and wanted to quickly share my experience in the same topic.

As I got closer to completion and began the querying process, I found myself trying to understand how long the average novel is.

Resoundingly, that answer is: 80k â€“ 120k words.  The short answer is that is a good length that keeps readers (and agents) engaged and follows a general standard.  Certain books/authors have definitely deviated from this, and have been successful, but know that this is the rule of thumb many agents use.

[Here](https://www.writersandartists.co.uk/writers/advice/33/preparing-for-submission/how-to-find-a-literary-agent/how-long-should-my-ms-be) is a deeper explanation on the topic, as well as [here](http://www.writersworkshop.co.uk/Numbers.html).
