So, someone on Twitter reached out to me regarding the query process and was hoping to get some advice.  Now, I don’t think there is any silver bullet for querying, but I did find some resources that I thought were helpful when I first started going and I wanted to share them here:

# The Query:

In short, this is your elevator pitch.  You have 30 seconds to capture a complete random strangers attention.  But, it’s harder than that, you have to do it while everyone else is screaming their pitch at them too.

# The Process:

Here is the link that really helped me out.  She breaks the query down into a template format that I found is really helpful when you first get started.  It also allows you to separate re-usable parts from custom, per agent, parts.

This is another link that also helps break the process down and emphasis one key aspect: personalization.  As I mentioned above, you are a nameless face, in a crowd of people yelling your idea at one person.  When you personalize your query (following the formats), you give a reason for an agent to look at you.  So far, every time I’ve personalized a query, I have received a non-generic response from the agent.

# The Example:

Now, I’m certainly not an expert in the field, but I thought it would be helpful if I pasted my first query that I wrote to my “dream” agent.  Ultimately, I was rejected, but I received really helpful feedback from her.

Dear Mx. X,


  Your passion for fantasy, science fiction, and relationships across characters from diverse backgrounds immediately grabbed my attention. Those specific interests motivated me to reach out to you in regards to my novel, Gemini Saga: Awakening.  This is the first book of a planned series known as, The Aaxym Chronicles.

 

  Awakening is the initial gateway and foundation for the planet of Aaxym.  The story revolves around a young man, named Aleric, and his journey of adventure, heroism and self, from his small village to the far reaches of his world.  His life is disrupted by a corrupt king, driven by a darker entity that seeks to sway the balance of power in his favor.  He is quickly accompanied by a female soldier, a tiger-human hybrid, that defies her allegiances to align her cause with his.  Together, they make their way north, to the goddess of light, where the reality of their world starts to unfold.

 

  Empowered, and reinforced with others, they make their way south to put a stop to the corruption that continues to spread across the land.  With each passing day, the group encounters gods, goddesses, dragons, and the undead.  The greatest battles, though, are still ahead and, by the end of Awakening, Aleric realizes he will need to leverage the very existence of his species, the Dragoons, and all of Aaxym’s strengths to overcome the darkness within.

  As a fellow gamer, you may come to appreciate some of the inspirations that come from the variety of stories found in role playing games and the tone is intended to follow in that light.  I believe the overall narrative of Awakening and, eventually, the series itself will connect with readers that enjoy titles that straddle both sci-fi and fantasy.  At just about 100,000 words, the novel is an introduction to the world of Aaxym and its history.

Thank you very much for your time,

Jason Wilczak
