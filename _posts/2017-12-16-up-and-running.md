Looks like the blog is up and running!

I used Amazon's Lightsail offering and it was a breeze!  I coupled it all with my Namecheap domain registrar and was up and running in no time.  I would suggest looking into it!

I also came across Wattpad and feel like I've been living under a rock...looking forward to pumping out a few short stories!

On top of that, working on that next book and looking for agents for book 1
