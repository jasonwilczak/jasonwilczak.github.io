Getting back into the swing of things after a, much needed, holiday break. Picking up on book 2 and still working through the high level outline. I feel like I’m hitting a bit of a wall in plot and character development, though :/ I know where I want the story to go, but i’m afraid i’m rushing the journey, but I don’t want to fluff the adventure with unnecessary filler also.

So, a couple of questions:

1) How do you stay on track?
-What methods do you use to reach your end state while providing enough color and fill to keep the story full?

2) How do you keep the focus?
-Maintenance of plot, places, people, creatures, lore, etc. It can get overwhelming!
