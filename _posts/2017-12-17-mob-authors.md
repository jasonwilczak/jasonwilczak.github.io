Hi all!

I just setup the new Mob Author project over in [Github](github.com/mobauthors).  The goal is to use Github and git flow to let a group of writers build out stories!

Essentially, anyone can add/edit any file with whatever they would like.  At the moment, it’s just me, however, as more people come on, they can approve, reject, or even request changes, with comments.  Ideally, we could work as a group and build out an entire story!

I put together the first one as a fantasy genre, no title and simply a chapter 1 file.  I would like to have as many genres as possible and even multiple stories as different genres.

What happens when we get a full story?

Well, I’m think we try to get it published and Github will keep track of all the collaborators so we can work out a very straight forward process to ensure everyone gets equal recognition and compensation (if there is any).

So, be the first to try out something brand new!  [MobAuthors](github.com/mobauthors)
