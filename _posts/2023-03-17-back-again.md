So I was really determined in 2018 and wrote 100k book on my cell phone while I road the bus to work every day.  It was an amazing experience, but I learned that getting published was actually going to be the hard part.  I hit a few road blocks and stumbled a bit on getting any bites or interest.  Additionally, I got some feedback from beta readers and took all the information to heart and got back to work.

Then we got hit by a pandemic....

You would think that being home and basically locked inside would have been the perfect situation for writing!  Unfortunately, the way my writing process worked caused me to completely de-rail.  I simply couldn't find the words and the determination to literally do anything.  That sort of bundled up with the changes I needed to make, the steam just stopped...

Well, here I am again, I'm back.  I got a new laptop that I can use unplugged, which is nice, and I started getting back into D&D with my kids.  Suddenly, the inspiration is back and I am ready to make progress again.  Here we go!
