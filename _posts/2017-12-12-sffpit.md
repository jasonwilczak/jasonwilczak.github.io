Just heard about #SFFPit from someone I follow and got really excited!  I just finished my first attempt at [#PitMad](/blog/2017/pitmad) and, even though it didn’t result in anything, it was a fun experience.

Now, hearing about this sci-fi/fantasy one, I’m really stoked.  I just finished putting all of my pitches together and leveraged Tweetdeck to schedule them up (it was really easy and intuitive).

I feel fortunate that i have 280 characters because that was hard enough to ram a 100k novel into with enough details to grab someone’s attention!  Below is about what I plan on using on 12/14, let me know what you think!

I’ll be posting a follow up to the experience as I watch it throughout the day.  Each tweet below is schedule to go out at 1 past the hour, every hour, from 8:01am to 5:01pm.
