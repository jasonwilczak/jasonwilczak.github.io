I am Jason Wilczak, a dedicated software engineer with a proven track record in leading complex technology projects and guiding development teams to success. My career journey is highlighted by a series of progressive roles that have honed my skills in delivering sophisticated software solutions tailored to meet challenging business requirements. My technical knowledge and leadership capabilities have been key to my achievements in the software engineering industry.

Beyond my professional life, I am also passionate about writing. I have the distinct experience of crafting a novel on my phone during daily commutes, which speaks to my commitment to my creative side, balancing it with a rigorous technical career.

Outside of work and creativity, I really enjoy video gaming across all systems.  I hope to tie my passion for world-building and technology into the ability to develop games.
